## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to tell a tale of poor security posture while showcasing the impact Drata's powerful Compliance as Code capabilities have in catching common IaC misconfigurations before they hit production. Whether you're a developer, a security professional, or just someone with a keen interest in cloud security, this repository is your playground for learning about the pitfalls to avoid in IaC!

_Before proceeding, please read the following disclaimer:_

> [!CAUTION]
> TerraFail contains multiple examples of common IaC misconfigurations. These were developed with the intention of showcasing the impact of Drata's Compliance as Code engine on improving organizational security posture. Use at your own discretion; Drata is not responsible for any damages.

**Please use caution when using this codebase and ensure that you have appropriate permissions to deploy resources in your cloud environment. Always follow best practices for securing your cloud infrastructure and consult with your organization's security team before deploying any code to live environments.**

## Leveling Up

Now that you're painfully aware of all the compliance gaps in your infrastructure, you're probably wondering what comes next. Hours of research and investigation to understand these results and eventually fix them in your environment? What if I told you what comes next could be as simple as clicking a button and letting Compliance as Code do the work for you? **Code Review Pro** provides a way to configure automated PRs for your repositories that will remediate security flaws just as quickly as they were introduced. Fix your IaC misconfigurations and developer headaches in one go by setting up **Code Review Pro**.

## Setting up Code Review Pro

Let's go over how to set-up **Code Review Pro** to enable automated remediation using GitHub PRs:

1. **Remember this screen? If you haven't yet opted in to this feature your first step here will be upgrading to Pro so you can configure code review settings**

2. **After pro has been enabled, you'll see options for code review settings that can be used to configure automated PRs for code remediation**

   - select a minimum severity to trigger PR creation
   - group all issues into one PR or opt for separate PRs to be created for each failed test
